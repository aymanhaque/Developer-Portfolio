          I currently attend the University of Texas at Dallas as a computer
          science major. I've started learning programming since I was 16 from
          my high school's programming classes and self learning. I plan on
          taking my interests further and making it a career. I've developed
          typing skills and a basic understanding of languages such as Python,
          and Javascript, and also have a basic understanding of web
          development.
